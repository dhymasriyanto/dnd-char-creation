The only hope in Etharis is that which you bring, yourself.",

Of course, payment in Shadowsteel or sufficient gold was also acceptable, allowing the rich to buy their curses as the poor pledged their service.",

The burgeoning swamp swallowed most of the temple, and thick mists closed off the stars from sight. The place of clarity became obscured and forgotten by most until it was put to darker purpose.",

For decades, the ordeal tree has rested atop one of the few hills that rise out of the swamp, feasting on the foolish and granting power to those of the darkest hearts. The latest, a dark werebear known as Folmar Duskscape, has camped in the ruins. Folmar seeks to gain more and more power from the ordeal tree, but the tree taunts him. It granted him power once, but despite surviving the ordeal three times, his further pleas have gone unanswered. Folmar is systematically seeking loopholes in the mystical bargain.",

Maybe the local guide is a spy for the enemy, and instead of leading them to the lair, he leads the characters astray. Time factors may also force the characters to make hard decisions. All that narrative power comes when we, as game masters, don't simply hand the characters the answers to their problems."

NPCs are no longer cardboard cutouts that sit idly by, waiting for rescue from danger, while the heroes go about their business. The lives of these NPCs are much more important to the characters, and to the unfolding narrative of the campaign, when they have important information and assistance to offer.",
